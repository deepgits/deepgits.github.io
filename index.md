I am a CS Grad and a technology generalist interested in product innovation, high-performance systems, internet companies, and all sorts of technology. I can deep dive into tech and go wide in business applications as needed. I believe in an all-hands-on-deck attitude, which is the fastest way to learn and grow.


I used to work for HCL Tech as a senior engineer looking after a top US telecom operator by facilitating their change management and business transformation projects. Before that, I have worked for multiple large MNCs, and before that, I sojourned to France to do my MBA.


ICEBREAKERS: Travel, Entrepreneurship.


I have a good interest in politics and history, significantly through the lens of geomorphology.
