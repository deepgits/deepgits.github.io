Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate and technology generalist with a passion for product innovation, high-performance systems, and the ever-evolving world of internet companies. My approach combines a deep dive into technical intricacies with a broad understanding of business applications, enabling me to navigate and lead effectively across diverse domains. I thrive in dynamic environments, embracing an all-hands-on-deck attitude as the fastest way to learn and grow.

Professionally, Iâ€™ve proven my capability in handling product development and driving organizational success. As a Senior Engineer at HCL Technologies, I facilitated change management and business transformation projects for a leading US telecom operator. Before that, I worked at Tech Mahindra, contributing to AI enablement projects for a Big Tech companyâ€™s AI research division. My role involved testing AI models by feeding data and training large language models (LLMs) to improve their accuracy and performance. My career also includes roles at global MNCs, and I enhanced my perspective on business and technology integration during my MBA studies in France.

**Beyond Work**
Iâ€™m fascinated by how geography, geomorphology, and the environment have shaped human societies over time, tying my interests in politics and history to a broader understanding of global dynamics. My personal icebreakers? Travel and entrepreneurship â€” two pursuits that constantly inspire me and fuel my drive to innovate and create.







**Now**
I am currently working on building a platform to empower digital publishers
